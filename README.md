The problem this tool attempts to solve is the inability to *quickly* answer
the question, "Can I check out this book on any the online resources available
with my library membership?".  Instead of spending 10-20 minutes searching
each app individually, it should be possible to programatically search all
legitimate catalogs for a specific title, author, or keyword.

As of March 2018, this project targets the sources:

* Hoopla
* RBDigital
* Overdrive

## Milestones ##

1. Search all sources for a given title, author, or keyword, and return
a list of results, including availability.
2. Link Goodreads ratings of each book to the results as well.
3. Automatically check out selected books.
